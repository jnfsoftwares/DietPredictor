    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how DietApp ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> DietApp is designed to work entirely on your device without requiring internet connectivity for its core functionality. All diet predictions and calculations are performed locally using a heuristic algorithm.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any information, there is no data to use or share.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data entered into the app (such as survey responses) remains stored locally on your device only. We do not transmit, store, or access this information on any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DietApp does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms. The app is completely self-contained.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect any personal information from children under 13. Since no data is collected at all, this policy applies equally to all users.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated policy available within the app.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/jnfsoftwares/DietApp">https://github.com/jnfsoftwares/DietApp</a></p>
